  <p> While Matt enjoys a privileged life, it was not always that way. Growing up in a rural town in Mississippi, he was exposed to the intersection of poverty and obesity. Matt's family struggles with chronic
    health problems, and as thus, he feels obligated to educate others on nutrition. Matt runs an Instagram account on healthy living, volunteers weekly with Gleaner's Food Bank, and additionally, he operates his own non-profit, Greens for Good, with his wife, Martha, to educate people on nutrition and to provide
    good meals to vulnerable people. Additionally, his business provides financial counseling to individuals to help them make better budgeting decisions at the store. His favorite vegetable is spinach for its wide variety of nutrients, its rich texture, and its versatality. Despite his impressive financial career, this
    has always been his most fulfilling work.</p>
